# Project Goal:
When you press a doorbell button, you complete an electrical circuit that allows household electricity to flow through the doorbell's internal electromagnet. The magnetic field generated by the electromagnet is then used to power a mechanism that creates the doorbell sound.
By placing the reed sensor next to the 'dumb doorbell' you can sense it's magnetic field and integrate it in your smart home setup, pretty neat huh?!
